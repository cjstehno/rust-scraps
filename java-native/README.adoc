# Java JNI with Rust

See: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jni/

Compile the Java `HelloWorld.java` file:

    javac HelloWorld.java

To generate the header (which is just to figure out the signatures - not used):

    javac -h HelloWorld.java

To build the library:

    cd mylib
    cargo build

Set the library path in your shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=mylib/target/debug

Run the java class:

    java HelloWorld

Which should yield:

    Hello, Rust!!
